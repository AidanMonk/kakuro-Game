                        Kakuro is a fun and simple number puzzle game! Your goal is to fill the empty boxes in the grid with numbers from 1 to 9 so that the sums match the clues provided. Each clue represents the total you need to achieve in its corresponding row or column. The trick is that numbers in a row or column canâ€™t repeat, so you need to think carefully about how to distribute them. Use logic and deduction to figure out the right numbers, and have fun solving the puzzle!
