 **Kakuro Game**  
Implementation of a Sudoku-like Kakuro puzzle game using Django and React.js. The game logic is entirely written in Python, allowing the boards to be verified as solved or not using a verification algorithm. Kakuro boards are serialized into JSON format, processed by Django, and transmitted to the React frontend via an API. From there the user can play and interact with the board, and send it back through the API to play the game.

 **About the Game**  
Kakuro is played on a grid where players fill in digits from 1-9 to satisfy the sum clues provided. Each sum clue indicates the total that the digits in that row or column should add up to, with no digit repeating in the same sum.
